            Using a function created in <a href='https://github.com/clickityKlein/snowbound'>Source - Google Functions</a>, the first step 
            was to use the scraped address in conjunction with the Google Geolocation API to find coordinates for each ski resort.

        <h5>Matching Resort Names</h5>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            A stated requirement within the sources section was to find consistent naming within our resort datasets. 
            This played a driving role in the creation of the function <code>match_resorts()</code>. Due to inconsistancies 
            within the resort names across the three sources, after an initial merge, not all resorts were a match. This function 
            returns a list of the closest responses and lets a user decide which resort is the actual match. After this was ran for 
            both Epic and Ikon, and then the three sources were merged together resulting in a final dataset with the Pass type for each resort.
        </p>

    <!-- step 3: proper addresses -->
    <div class="container">
        <br>
        <h5>Proper Address Components</h5>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            When the main ski resort data was initially scraped, there was an attempt to extract columns of general location, such as 
            region, state, and city. This proved to be inconsistent and overall unsuccessful. To account for this, address components such as 
            state (United States) and province/territory (Canada), as well as city were extracted via a backwards application of the Google Geolocation API. 
            This actually included a step into using the Google Places API as well. When state/province/territory and city were not available during the 
            first iteration of obtaining proper address components, nearby business locations were iterated through until the required components were found.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Snippets and null values for the proper address and address unpacking are found below.

            By referencing the results above, "long_name" and "locality_type_0" were results of interest. Values of interest contained in 
            "locality_type_0" are "administrative_area_level_1" and "locality", which are equivalent to "state/province/territory" and "city", respectively.

        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Again back to the consistent resort naming, the function <code>clean_text_v1()</code> was created to aid in this endeavor. 
            The main drivers which prompted this were non-uniform alphabetical characters, mainly due to French areas in Canada. Additionally, 
            some resorts had unnecessary details in parentheses and extra spaces. Text was normalized.

        <h5>Dropping Columns and Rows</h5>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            In an effort to retain as much information as possible, columns and rows were dropped intelligently. Rows containig an "indoor resort" indicator 
            were removed, as the scope of this project is mountainous outdoor resorts. Some columns with an unrecoverable amount of missing data or were unnecessary were removed as well:
            <ul>
                <li>Region: only has North America</li>
                <li>Country: lowercase country has longname</li>

                <li>Locale 2: administrative_area_level_1 & locality better contain a better summary</li>
                <li>Link: only required for scraping purposes</li>
                <li>Address: messy and administrative_area_level_1 & locality better contain a better summary</li>
                <li>Snow reliability: over 84% missing values</li>
                <li>Slope preparation: over 84% missing values</li>
                <li>Access, on-site parking: over 84% missing values</li>
                <li>Snow reliability: over 84% missing values</li>

                <li>Apr√®s-ski: over 84% missing values</li>
                <li>Accommodation offering directly at the slopes and lifts: over 84% missing values</li>

        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Columns still containig null values were:
            <ul>
                <li>Price: 8.7% missing</li>
                <li>Pass: 82.1% missing</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Solutions for these missing values were found:
            <ul>
                <li>Price: since resort rating had no null values, the average price of resorts with a nearby rating (tolerance of 0.1) was used.</li>
                <li>Pass: although 82.1% of missing data is usually an indicator to drop a column, this simply meant the resort wasn't 
                    under Epic or Ikon, and was given the value of "Other".
                </li>
