        <h3>Weather Data</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            The weather data API provided a few years of daily weather observations across thousands of stations, which were aggregated 
            by the API call into generalized weather observations for coordinates associated with ski resorts. Ultimately, the weather variables were 
            the goal but had a subsequent outcome of data surrounding weather stations.

        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Understanding the variables within the weather data is essential to not only applying the data, but also dealing with null values and outliers. Thankfully, 
            visualcrossing provides a breakdown of the variables. The details are as follows:

                <li>severerisk (forecast only): a value between 0 and 100 representing the risk of convective storms (e.g. thunderstorms, hail and tornadoes). Severe risk is a scaled measure that combines a variety of other fields such as the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN), predicted rain and wind. Typically, a severe risk value less than 30 indicates a low risk, between 30 and 70 a moderate risk and above 70 a high risk.

        <h5>Dropping Columns & Searching for Outliers</h5>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Gaining an initial understanding of the data provided insight into columns not applicable to the scope of this timeframe or were 
            essentially duplicate and inferior information of other columns.
            <ul>
                <li>Epoch Columns: drop due to irrelevance of scope to 1970 in this project</li>
                <li>conditions & description: combination of preciptype and icon were superior</li>
                <li>source: since this was historical data, all source is observational data</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Outliers were then searched for in some of the remaining numeric type columns.

        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Two main phenomenon were illuminated by this visualization. Namely:
            <ul>
                <li>visibility has an outlier: according to an article by <a href="https://time.com/archive/6766128/science-how-far-can-you-see/"> [Time]</a>, the maximum distance at 25,000 feet of elevation results in a visibility distance of 194 miles on a perfect day.</li>
                <li>severerisk has non-null values that range between 0-100: it was suppposed to be a forecast only variable.</li>

        <h5>Dealing with Null Values</h5>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            After replacing the visibility outlier with a Null value instead of dropping the entire row, the null values were taken care of 
            with methods which retained rows as well:
            <ul>
                <li>windgust: average windgust for resort and month</li>
                <li>visibility: average windgust for resort and month</li>
                <li>solarradiation: average windgust for resort and month</li>
                <li>solarenergy: average windgust for resort and month</li>
                <li>uvindex: average windgust for resort and month</li>
                <li>preciptype: only null when there is no precipitation, and remainder of data is currently in list type format, replace with "['None']"</li>
                <li>tzoffset: only null when timezone is different from the global time zone offset, replace with 0</li>
                <li>severerisk: only null when severerisk is 0, replace with 0</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Unpacking Lists</h5>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            There were 2 list type columns which required unpacking.
            <br><br>
            
            For preciptype, <code>MultiLabelBinarizer()</code> from scikit-learn was used to 
            create numeric representations of booleans in their own columns. In other words, it was encoded.
            <br><br>
            
            For stations, given there were thousands, an encoding approach might not be the best at this point. The column in list type format 
            was left in. However, a basket type dataframe was created and saved from this for possible later use in an apriori method or model.
