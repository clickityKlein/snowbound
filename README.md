# Snowbound Analytics

This project examines patterns and phenomena surrounding ski resort areas. Ratings and other attributes of ski resorts are examined, along with 
weather and businesses. Data is aggregated and cleaned using numerous sources, and then explored with viusalizations and machine learning algorithms.

The full process is displayed in Python scripts found within this repository. The methodologies and results can be found in this [website.](https://snowbound-0fqq.onrender.com/)
